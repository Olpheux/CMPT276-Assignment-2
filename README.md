Second assignment for CMPT276 at SFU, Spring 2022 semester

Learning to use NodeJS. 

1. Create a simple database containing a few rectangles (with name, color, height, and width attributes), with the ability to add or delete any rectangles. 
2. Also need a page to view a summary of all rectangles currently in the database (containing only simple info, such as name and color). 
3. Clicking on the name of a rectangle should redirect you to another page with the full information about that one rectangle.

A simple UI mockup is recommended, but not strictly necessary. Description of assignment suggests we will iterate on this assignment later, and it will prove useful for that, so making it now is likely a good plan.

Like first assignment, should be on Github (or equivalent), and usable on Heroku.
